INSTALLATION NOTES:
-------------------------------------------
This installation will add a number of files
and subfolders into the folder you select 
for the installation. 

No files will be added into any folder other 
than the selected folder (except for a 
shortcut to DragDrop.hlp added to the 
Desktop). An installation log file will be 
added to the specified folder giving the 
complete list of files added.

If, during the installation, the 
"Check for Upgrades" option is selected,
this installation executable will also be 
copied to the selected Install folder and 
a "Check for Upgrades" shortcut will be 
created pointing to this copied executable.

Once the installation is complete, further 
instructions on how to add these drag and 
drop components to Delphi's IDE can be found
in DragDrop.hlp along with instructions on 
how to enable context sensitive help for 
these components.

-------------------------------------------
IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM A VERSION PRIOR 
TO VERSION 3.4, IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED 
THAT YOU READ THE NOTES IN DragDrop.hlp ON
