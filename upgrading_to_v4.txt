Feedback:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have attempted to maintain the greatest possible backward compatibility with
earlier versions of the Drag and Drop Component Suite. If you encounter any
compatibility problems not addressed in this document, plase let me know about
them so they can be fixed.

Also, if you have created and are using custom drag and drop components based on
a previous version of the Drag and Drop Component Suite, I urge you to contact
me.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Architectural changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The TInterfacedComponent class has moved from the DropSource unit to the
  DragDrop unit.

- All source and target components now uses TClipboardFormat and TDataFormat
  objects for data conversion and transfer.

- The TDropSource class has been deprecated and has been moved to the
  DropSource3 unit. It is provided for backwards compatibility only and will be
  removed in a future version. Instead use either the TCustomDropSource or the
  TCustomDropMultiSource classes which replaces the TDropSource class as the
  drop source base classes. The TCustomDropMultiSource base class should be used
  for all new development.

- The TDropTarget class has been deprecated, but is still located in the
  DropTarget unit. It is provided for backwards compatibility only and will be
  removed in a future version. Instead use the TCustomDropTarget or the
  TCustomDropMultiTarget classes which replaces the TDropTarget class as the
  drop target base class. The TCustomDropMultiTarget base class should be used
  for all new development.

- All drop source components now descend from the new TCustomDropMultiSource
  class which descends from TCustomDropSource.

- All drop target components now descend from the new TCustomDropMultiTarget
  class which descends from TCustomDropTarget.

- The component glyphs of TDropBMPSource and TDropBMPTarget has changed. The new
  TDropImageTarget component uses the old TDropBMPTarget glyph.

- CutToClipboard and CopyToClipboard now places live data on the clipboard
  instead of a static snapshot of the data. This is nescessary to support
  "delete on paste". The implications of this is that there is a direct link
  between the clipboard and the drop source component. If you modify the data
  of the source component (e.g. clear TDropTextSource.Text), you will also
  modify the data on the clipboard. The drop source component's FlushClipboard
  method can be used to "freeze" the data on the clipboard and the
  EmptyClipboard method can be used to empty the clipboard.

- The TDropSource.InternalCutCopyToClipboard method has been deleted.

- The TDropSource.CutOrCopyToClipboard does not need to be implemented in
  descendant classes anymore and it is advisable not to do so.

- All clipboard format registrations are now done by the TClipboardFormat
  descendant classes. In previous versions, the registration values were
  available via global variables (CF_TEXT, CF_IDLIST etc.), but these variables
  are no longer available. If you need access to the registration values, you
  should instead use the TClipboardFormat.GetClipboardFormat class methods.
  E.g. to retrieve the registration value for the "FileGroupDescriptor" format,
  use the TFileGroupDescritorClipboardFormat.GetClipboardFormat class method.
  Alternatively, you can also use the RegisterClipboardFormat API function to
  retrieve the regitration value directly. Either methods are equally valid.

- The ShellMalloc global variable has moved from the DropSource unit to the
  DragDrop unit.

- Target components now supports multiple drop targets.
  Previous versions only allowed one control to be registered as a drop target
  per target component and registering subsequent targets would automatically
  unregister the previous drop target. This behavious can be emulated by setting
  the target component's MultiTarget property to False. When MultiTarget is
  False, registering a target will automatically unregister the previous target.
  If MultiTarget is True, registering a target will not unregister any previous
  targets.
